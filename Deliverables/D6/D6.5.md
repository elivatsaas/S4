Brady: To keep the C++ scheduling algorithm clean and understandable one of the first things I did each week was go through and clean it up. Sometimes this would be renaming some variables to better understand, while other times I found whole blocks of code that were redundant and lead to simplification of the code to help the others understand my code as well.

Tyler: To keep the website code easily modified and understandable, I went through and renamed the div/frames that all the elements were encased in to be easily understandable so that the CSS could easily be updated and have new elements added to the code. Furthermore, I kept the naming convention similar throughout the pages so that others would know what to look for on each page.
