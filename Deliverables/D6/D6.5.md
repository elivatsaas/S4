Brady: To keep the C++ scheduling algorithm clean and understandable one of the first things I did each week was go through and clean it up. Sometimes this would be renaming some variables to better understand, while other times I found whole blocks of code that were redundant and lead to simplification of the code to help the others understand my code as well.

Eli: For the Node.js backend, in order to ensure code quality I did three main things. I followed an Udemy course on Node.js, which was extremely helpful in learning the correct structure of code in Node.js. Another tool that was extremely helpful was Prettier. Prettier kept my code structure consistent, automatically formatting on every save. By ensuring that code is consistent, it becomes more readable, which in turn improves code quality. The last tool used to ensure code quality on the Node.js backend was ESLint. ESLint checked for potential uncaught problems in my code, caught syntax errors, as well as reported when my code structure was not consistent with best practices. ESLint was a huge tool in ensuring code quality on the backend.
