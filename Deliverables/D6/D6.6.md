Brady: During this second release it felt way more structured than the first release as I was much more on top of the work I needed to complete and specifically better pacing so I wasn't doing everything all at once. However something I learned is that the bigger and more complicated your code becomes how the requirements for testing grows exponentially.

Tyler: During our second release, we were much more organized in terms of who was doing what and we had open communication leading up to it that allowed us to get everything done without too much of a struggle. In additon, this communication was also very necessary due to the fact that the product had grown a lot and become much more complex and we needed to communicate to understand everything that was going on.
