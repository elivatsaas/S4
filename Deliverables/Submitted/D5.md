# Description

Our software is an easy to implement scheduling software. Utilizing a clear interface, the users are able to enter as many shifts over as long of a period as they would like, with no limit to how long a schedule can be, users are also able to enter available hours of many employees, the role of the employee, employee hour requests along with maximums, using this data the built in algorithm will sort through the data and fill up the schedule, displaying a fully completed version if it exists, otherwise giving the user the best available schedule of the data that is inputted. It then formats the data in a way that is easy to understand and multiple ways to display that data. This offloads the hours of work of using trial and error to create a schedule that makes everyone happy. This could be applicable to any industry a schedule is made where shifts are used and needed to be filled.

## Explanation:
We designed our architecture for S4 in this way so that it would be easy for the client/user to be able to operate on the front end
without having to worry to much about the back end side of things. To do this, we have the website with its user interface set up on the front end
that uses the node.js api to communicate with our database and back end code. This makes it so that all the user has to understand is the interface
from the front end perspective and not be required to know all the intricacies of the behinds the scenes functionality since it is handled for them
by the api communication with our back end.

## Use Case: User Enters Availibility Information Into the Web Client

![](https://github.com/elivatsaas/S4/blob/Elliot_Deliverable_5/Deliverables/Media/5.4.png)

Use Case:
A user logs into the website and fills in information on when they will be availible, then submits the information into the database

# Design Patterns

The first design pattern is the factory method (See D5.5-1).
Handler: https://github.com/elivatsaas/S4/blob/main/server/src/handlers/scheduleHandlers.js
Role Handler: https://github.com/elivatsaas/S4/blob/main/server/src/handlers/roleHandlers.js
Shift Handler: https://github.com/elivatsaas/S4/blob/main/server/src/handlers/shiftHandlers.js

The second design pattern is the decorator pattern (See D5.5-2).
Shift: https://github.com/elivatsaas/S4/blob/main/server/src/handlers/shiftHandlers.js
Employee Shift: https://github.com/elivatsaas/S4/blob/main/server/src/handlers/roleHandlers.js
Store Shift: https://github.com/elivatsaas/S4/blob/main/server/src/handlers/storeHandlers.js

# Design Principles


Single Responsibility Principle:

The EmployeeType class is only there to store all of the employees, and is only changed when an employee is added or removed (class below):

class EmployeeType
    {
    private:
        int arrSize;

    public:
        Employee *empArr;
        int employeeCount;
        int totalRequested;

        EmployeeType()
        {
            employeeCount = 0;
            empArr = new Employee[0];
            arrSize = 0;
        }
        EmployeeType(int empCount)
        {
            employeeCount = empCount;
            empArr = new Employee[empCount];
            arrSize = 0;
        }
        void setArrSize(int newSize)
        {
            arrSize = newSize;
        }
        void incrementArrSize()
        {
            setArrSize(arrSize + 1);
        }
        void decrementArrSize()
        {
            setArrSize(arrSize - 1);
        }
        int getArrSize()
        {
            return arrSize;
        }
    };


Open/Closed Principle:

Within that same EmployeeType class the class is open to use the employee struct however the EmployeeType does not use any of the employee struct itself.


Liskov Substitution Principle:

In main we could replace employees.empArr with a new pointer array of employees built within main and the code would function the same. Here is an example of one line that could change:

employees.empArr[loopIndex].shiftList = new Shift[shiftCount];
to
Employee *empArr[employeeCount[
empArr[loopIndex].shiftList = new Shift[shiftCount];


Interface Segregation Principle:

At the time of this deliverable this is not yet implemented, however we plan to add the ability to input for seperate stores. However in the case of only 1 store existing we will forgo that option and it wont be necessary to use.


Dependency Inversion Principle:

Within the algorithm that assigns an employee to all the shifts, we must make sure that the employee we are trying to assign do not already have overlapping shifts. The line of code that does this is as follows:

if(!checkForOverlap(employees->empArr[empExists], shifts->sftArr[shiftIndex]))

This line does not care how the checkForOverlap function works, and there are many different ways to implement this function, it just needs to know if this employee has an overlap with this shift.
