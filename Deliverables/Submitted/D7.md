### What Is It? 
S4 is a auto-scheduling software designed for a business of small to medium size to manage and assign their hours for their 
employees.  Using our easy to use web portal, managers are able to recieve the availibility and desired hours of their employees 
in order to assign them hours.  Within the same portal, employees can provie their hours and see announcements about thier current 
hours.  All of this is in a simple browser with clean and easy to use design.  

### How Does It Work?
S4 is built on ReactJS and NodeJS, two technologies designed to run right in the browser for maximum responsiveness.  Using web-
based data storage, current hours sync across devices to be visible by anyone logged in with the appropriate permissions.  
Additionally, the built in announcements system can link direclty to employees emails, so they don't even have to direclty visit 
the web browser!

# Acceptance Test Example:  
``` javascript
import React from "react";
import EmployeeScheduleCalendar from "../../src/components/Schedule";
import shiftsData from "../fixtures/formattedShifts.json"; // Import shifts data from shifts.json file

describe("<EmployeeScheduleCalendar />", () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Calculate earliestStartTime, latestEndTime, and earliestDate before each test
    const earliestStartTime = Math.min(
      ...shiftsData.map((shift) => new Date(shift.start).getTime())
    );
    const latestEndTime = Math.max(
      ...shiftsData.map((shift) => new Date(shift.end).getTime())
    );
    const earliestDate = new Date(
      Math.min(
        ...shiftsData.map((shift) => new Date(shift.start).setHours(0, 0, 0, 0))
      )
    );

    // Define the props for the EmployeeScheduleCalendar component
    const props = {
      defaultView: "day",
      views: ["day", "week", "month"], // Allow all view types
      step: 30,
      timeslots: 2,
      min: earliestStartTime,
      max: latestEndTime,
      defaultDate: earliestDate, // Start of the week containing the earliest shift
      eventPropGetter: (event) => ({
        className: event.employeeId ? "employee" : "no-employee",
      }),
      style: {
        height: "calc(120vh - 100px)", // Adjust the height of the calendar container
        zIndex: 1, // Ensure the calendar is on top of other elements
      },
      dayLayoutAlgorithm: "no-overlap",
    };

    // Mount the component before each test with the defined props
    cy.mount(<EmployeeScheduleCalendar {...props} shiftsData={shiftsData} />);
  });

  it("renders", () => {
    // Ensure the calendar container is visible
    cy.get(".schedule-container").should("be.visible");
    // Check if the "Loading..." text exists and then ensure it doesn't
    cy.contains("Loading...").should("not.exist");
  });

  it("displays shift information on event select", () => {
    // Ensure the calendar container is visible
    cy.get(".schedule-container").should("be.visible");
    // Wait for the calendar events to be rendered
    cy.get(".rbc-event").should("exist"); // Check if .rbc-event exists
    // Click on the first event
    cy.get(".rbc-event").first().trigger("click", { force: true });
    // Ensure that the popup exists
    cy.get(".popup").should("exist");
    // Check if the shift information is displayed correctly
    cy.contains("Shift Information").should("exist");
    cy.contains("Employee:").should("exist");
    cy.contains("Role:").should("exist");
    cy.contains("Store:").should("exist");
    cy.contains("Start:").should("exist");
    cy.contains("End:").should("exist");
  });
});

# Explanation
This acceptance test is created for the sites schedule component. It starts by loading in the schedule component, as well as mock data to use. It then describes the test, first calculating the earliest and latest shift start times, as well as the earliest shift date. These are necessary for the schedule. It then defines the data that will be passed to the component, which includes the derived values, as well as shift data and styles. It then mounts the component with the required data. The test then renders the schedule component. Once rendered, the test checks that the schedule is visible, and then automates a click on a shift event, which should create a popup. It then checks this popup exists, and that the necessary employee data exists. If this passes, we know our schedule component is functioning.

## 7.3

## Evaluation 1: Manager at Chipotle
- Feels like competitors do
- More options than I have seen with competitors
- Having the ability to do multiple roles at once was not something I've seen before
- Load time is slow, makes it seem like the computer is slow
- Seeing everything in one place is very useful
 
## Evaluation 2: Lead at Noble Ground Coffee
- Everything is easy to find and use
- All employees are listed and able to viewed
- Liked being able to easily filter the scheduling page as needed
- Liked being able to easily change or add a shift to the schedule
- Design is a bit too simplistic for my taste, but I would use it for work
- Loading times on certain pages were a bit cumbersome

## Evaluation 3: Brown Bag Burger Employee
- Good navigation, but load times are a bit annoying on certain pages
- Easily understandable announcement page, with simple to use announcement system
- Liked the filters on the scheduling page, made it easier to see evrything
- Wished employee shift pop ups weren't in military time
- Felt that website had everything needed in it for simple scheduling
