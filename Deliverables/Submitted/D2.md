## 2.1
Problem Statement:

The problem of inefficient scheduling in workplaces with in consitent schedules affects schedule makers; the impact of which is spending hours longer than 
necessary creating schedules, wasting employeer money. 

Product Position Statement:

For schedule makers who spend hours weekly creating schedules, S4 is a scheduling software that autogenerates a schedule considering employee availability, 
roles employee is eligible to work, stores the employee is eligble to work, preferred hours, seniority, and overtime considerations. 
S4 will also allow shift trades, annoucements, and metrics to make the scheduling process smoother. Unlike the paper scheduling many of our interviewed 
clients rely on, our product will generate a schedule, while highlighting conflicts, in moments. This gives managers more time to be doing other work, or 
getting extra time off work. 

Value Proposition:
S4 is a scheduling software that allows schedule makers to save hours weekly while making schedules, generating schedules based on employee needs and employeer needs, 
all while making it as easy and efficent to use as possible.

Customer Segment:
Schedule makers, employees, employeers

# Functional Requirements

1. Autogenerate Schedules
2. Ease of Use
3. Filter Options for Schedules
4. Shift Trades
5. Announcement System
6. Conflict Recognition/Highlighting

## 2.4 

Non-Functional Requirements

1. Usability
  - Objective Goal/Importance: The scheduling system shall have a well defined User UI on its website so that users will easily be able to use and learn the system.

2. Functional Stability
  - Objective Goal/Importance: The scheduling system will not have severe errors and will highligh any minor errors/conflicts so that managers will not have to modify the schedule much.

3. Reliability
  - Objective Goal/Importance: The scheduling system will not crash on any invalid inputs so that and user can rely on the system even if they make a mistake.

4. Performance Effeciency
  - Objective Goal/Importance: The scheduling system will be able to handle multiple employee availabilities and still quickly generate a schedule so that it will be efficent and viable for companies to use.

## 2.5

MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

For S4 our minimum viable product would be the most barebones possible scheduling algorithms with no specific options. The product would be able to take input
of required shifts to fill, the workers who would be filling in those shifts, and the times those workers were available.

Currently the plan is to start with a recursive backtracking algorithm that will use a strategic guess and check method of trying all options until something works.
It is also a must to have the option to manually edit the shcedule once it has been generated, so that will be possible in our MVP.

Using the Wizard of Oz method will be super helpful in something so visual like transferring shifts manually. Letting us figure out the thinking process using 
human brain power at first and think through our own algorithm.

To validate it while testing we can look to work with a schedule maker, to take the information from them and use our MVP during testing to see if it will 
create something that will work in practice instead of just passing the thinking test.

4. Employees view the shift schedule for the week with their hours

5. Employees trade one of their shifts with another worker when they are not available
