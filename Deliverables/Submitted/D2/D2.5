MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

For S4 our minimum viable product would be the most barebones possible scheduling algorithms with no specific options. The product would be able to take input
of required shifts to fill, the workers who would be filling in those shifts, and the times those workers were available.

Currently the plan is to start with a recursive backtracking algorithm that will use a strategic guess and check method of trying all options until something works.
It is also a must to have the option to manually edit the shcedule once it has been generated, so that will be possible in our MVP.

Using the Wizard of Oz method will be super helpful in something so visual like transferring shifts manually. Letting us figure out the thinking process using 
human brain power at first and think through our own algorithm.

To validate it while testing we can look to work with a schedule maker, to take the information from them and use our MVP during testing to see if it will 
create something that will work in practice instead of just passing the thinking test.
