## 6.1

Our scheduling software provides easy and thorough access to scheduling for shifts in all kinds of work.  Our streamlined process 
for taking in information and scheduling saves managers hours of work with a spreadsheet attempting to make all workers happy.  
Businesses of many sizes can collect, build, and communicate their created schedules all from one easy to use web portal.  Our 
snappy web interface is straightforward to use, to reduce time needed to onboard.  You can’t go wrong selecting S4!

Users can sign up, and collect their names, personal information, hire date, and pay rate to be used in later calculations within 
the system.  They can also use the interface to create their own user account, and set up password protection to stop others from 
accessing the personal information.  Our software includes a message board, that managers and bosses can communicate with each 
other and their employees easily all in one place.  These messages can be filtered so that the most recent or relevant messages 
can be easily isolated for each person.  Messages can be tagged by role at the company so that assigned tasks are completed by the 
right people.  Announcements can even be automatically emailed to the relevant parties through the web server.  Once employees are 
added, simply tag their names on their respective shifts to add them to the auto generated calendar. Information about that shift 
can be easily seen by mousing over, and the shift can even be edited if the availability changes.

## 6.5

Brady: To keep the C++ scheduling algorithm clean and understandable one of the first things I did each week was go through and clean it up. Sometimes this would be
renaming some variables to better understand, while other times I found whole blocks of code that were redundant and lead to simplification of the code to help the
others understand my code as well.

Eli: For the Node.js backend, in order to ensure code quality I did three main things. I followed an Udemy course on Node.js, which was extremely helpful in learning
the correct structure of code in Node.js. Another tool that was extremely helpful was Prettier. Prettier kept my code structure consistent, automatically formatting
on every save. By ensuring that code is consistent, it becomes more readable, which in turn improves code quality. The last tool used to ensure code quality on the
Node.js backend was ESLint. ESLint checked for potential uncaught problems in my code, caught syntax errors, as well as reported when my code structure was not
consistent with best practices. ESLint was a huge tool in ensuring code quality on the backend. 

Tyler: To keep the website code easily modified and understandable, I went through and renamed the div/frames that all the elements were encased in to be easily
understandable so that the CSS could easily be updated and have new elements added to the code. Furthermore, I kept the naming convention similar throughout the
pages so that others would know what to look for on each page. 

Elliot: The best methods we found for code quality was maintaining modularity and atomicity.  Keeping the different parts of the code separate in as many ways as
possible helped to prevent small pieces of code from having larger effects that could cause other things to break.  Clear communication within the team about how
segments of the code should work allowed for separate pieces to fit together well.  If a piece did have issues, it was easy to test what worked and how to fix it,
because each piece was separate and identifiable. 

Joseph: To help keep the C++ algorithm clean and easy to bug fix was to create small, simple, supporting programs and then combine them into the algorithm. I tested
every bit of software I created to ensure that it was bug-free and 100% working as intended. I would also go back and look over old functions that I had made to see
if there was an easier/ more efficient way of doing the same process. 

## 6.6

Brady: During this second release it felt way more structured than the first release as I was much more on top of the work I needed to complete and specifically
better pacing so I wasn't doing everything all at once. However something I learned is that the bigger and more complicated your code becomes how the requirements
for testing grows exponentially.

Eli: There were several important things I learned throughout this release. One of the main things I learned was time management. Being able to accurately predict
how long a task would take, and giving myself appropriate time for that task has been extremely important in completing the project. I also had to learn the
technology, and be able to start working with it in a short amount of time. Having this skill will be extremely beneficial in my future. Although I think the most
important thing I learned had to do with planning. Not only the importance of planning, but coming into this project, I didn’t even know what needed to plan. This
project gave me valuable insight into necessary planning skills in a software project. 

Tyler: During our second release, we were much more organized in terms of who was doing what and we had open communication leading up to it that allowed us to get
everything done without too much of a struggle. In additon, this communication was also very necessary due to the fact that the product had grown a lot and become
much more complex and we needed to communicate to understand everything that was going on.

Elliot: Over the course of developing the second part of the project, the team learned more about the importance of clarifying details in the planning process of the
code, vs broad ideas being formed into code.  In class, many ideas were mentioned about how to unify a team to make sure the final product is a focused result, and
reduce the time spent fixing pieces that were made outside of the final vision.  The team made great strides in coming together to create a singular product, also
probably helped by the fact that the prototype was finally visible. 

Joseph: During the beginning of the project, we were much less organized and informed on what needed to get done. Being our first major project built from scratch,
it was very hard to determine the workload and we didn't communicate as much with each other. In the second release, it was like a night and day difference. Everyone
in the team was much more open about what they were doing and what help they needed.
