S4 is a scheduling software that allows schedule makers to save hours weekly while making schedules, generating schedules based on employee and employer needs, all while making it as easy and efficient to use as possible. The goal of S4 is to solve the problem of inefficient scheduling in workplaces within consistent schedules affects schedule makers; the impact of which is spending hours longer than necessary creating schedules, wasting employer money and employee time. S4 is designed for schedule makers who spend hours weekly creating schedules, it is a scheduling software that autogenerates a schedule considers including but not limited to employee availability, roles employee is eligible to work, stores the employee is eligible to work, preferred hours, seniority, and overtime considerations. To help managers, S4 will also allow shift trades, announcements, and metrics to make the scheduling process smoother. Unlike the paper scheduling many of our interviewed clients rely on, our product will generate a schedule, while highlighting conflicts, in moments. This gives managers more time to do other work or get extra time off work. 

Autogenerate Schedules: To do this we will look at each employee and look at a few factors like hours requested, seniority, trust, role, and most importantly availability. We also hope to include at least one employee with the role of manager, or a high level of trust present always. To allow the users access there will be the role of schedule maker as well. We hope our program thinks through the schedule making process just like a human scheduler would make it, just in a fraction of the time.

Conflict Recognition/Highlighting: After creating the schedule there will be a run through to check that the schedule is valid and then flag any conflicts like no employee found to fill the shift, employee working 2 shifts at once, or there being overlap between the employeeâ€™s unavailability and a shift that they are scheduled for. This will then allow the user to go through and manually fix any issues with the schedule that are found in the conflict algorithm.
