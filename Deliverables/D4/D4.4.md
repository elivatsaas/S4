##Adopted Technologies

#Javascript

For the backend data management, Javascript was the most straightforward way to integrate logic into our scheduling software.  This code acts as a bridge to the C++ code that does the heavy lifting.

#HTML / CSS

For the design of our website, we have used HTML to structure our pages, with interactive elements.  This allows users to easily view the calendar, and use clearly labeled buttons to interface with the program.

#C++

For creating the algorithm that actually manages and changes the schedule based on what times employees provide, C++ is utilized.  The team's familiarity with C code helps this part of the project, and C's memory management and data management techniques helps to implement this feature.

#Makefile

We've implemented a makefile to allow for easy compiling of our code, which is important for testing new features quickly.
