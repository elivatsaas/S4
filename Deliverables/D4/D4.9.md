# Look & Feel
For S4, we wanted to make the user interface relatively simple and easy to use so that users would not have a hard time figuring out 
what to do. Furthermore, we wanted to ensure that the simplicity of the interface would not take away from what you could do with it.
For instance, while the scheduling page may look simple with the calendar and a couple buttons, you can still easily add data into the 
database or change information on the respective button pages. For example, the add employee button will take you to a page with a simple
form that will not let you submit it until all the required information is put in. This makes it so the user does not have to worry about 
not putting enough data in for the database to use and only has to focus on not mispelling anything. We believe that this type of approach
will make it so users have a relatively simple time figuring out how to use our system while not having to worry about the system making a 
mistake due to them putting in an invalid value.
