#Learning and Training

##University Schooling

For the portions of the program written in C++, the team has knowledge from previously taken classes at NAU.  This prior knowledge of data structures and algorithms was critical to creating the schedule making  components of this project.

##Udemy Course

For integrating the C++ code into a website, and using javascript to tie these components together, an online course was done by members of the group.  This knowledge was very important to the integration of different technologies present in our project.

##Prior Experience

Some of the techniques used in creating websites and implementing them was known by members of the group either through personal projects they had worked on before this project, or a class taken at a school they had attended in the past.
