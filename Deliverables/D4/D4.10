One of the major problems that we faced during this first version was connecting all the parts. We had to get data from the front-end website, store it in the back-end 
database, be able to run code on it, and then be able to generate schedules to the front end. The reason it was so challenging was because of all the different languages
that we were transfering through. The front end uses html, css, and java while the backend is a SQL database and the functions we run on the data are c++. We were able
to connect them using Node.js, libraries, and by figuring out the syntax to get, store, and send data. 

For the next version, we plan on mainly polishing up the code and website we currently have while also implementing a couple more features.
