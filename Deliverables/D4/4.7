We chose the GNU General Public License v3.0 for out project because we wanted to make it so
anyone could see and access our work, but would not be able to create a closed source version of our work.
This means that people can do whatever they would like with our project in terms of cloning the repository
and modifying it, but they would not be able to create and distribute a closed souce version of it. Furthermore, 
this means that anyone that would like to make use of our code and ideas would be required to maintain the open source
nature of the project itself and not close it off for their own purposes. This means that our project will
always be available to use and make imporvements upon, but anyone that does this will be required to maintain
the same stance of openess and sharing of progress.
