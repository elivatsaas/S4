## Super Sick Scheduling Software 

### What Is It? 
S4 is a auto-scheduling software designed for a business of small to medium size to manage and assign their hours for their 
employees.  Using our easy to use web portal, managers are able to recieve the availibility and desired hours of their employees 
in order to assign them hours.  Within the same portal, employees can provie their hours and see announcements about thier current 
hours.  All of this is in a simple browser with clean and easy to use design.  

### How Does It Work?
S4 is built on ReactJS and NodeJS, two technologies designed to run right in the browser for maximum responsiveness.  Using web-
based data storage, current hours sync across devices to be visible by anyone logged in with the appropriate permissions.  
Additionally, the built in announcements system can link direclty to employees emails, so they don't even have to direclty visit 
the web browser!
