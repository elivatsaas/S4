## Evaluation 1: Manager at Chipotle
- Feels like competitors do
- More options than I have seen with competitors
- Having the ability to do multiple roles at once was not something I've seen before
- Load time is slow, makes it seem like the computer is slow
- Seeing everything in one place is very useful
 
## Evaluation 2: Lead at Noble Ground Coffee
- Everything is easy to find and use
- All employees are listed and able to viewed
- Liked being able to easily filter the scheduling page as needed
- Liked being able to easily change or add a shift to the schedule
- Design is a bit too simplistic for my taste, but I would use it for work
- Loading times on certain pages were a bit cumbersome

## Evaluation 3: Brown Bag Burger Employee
- Good navigation, but load times are a bit annoying on certain pages
- Easily understandable announcement page, with simple to use announcement system
- Liked the filters on the scheduling page, made it easier to see evrything
- Wished employee shift pop ups weren't in military time
- Felt that website had everything needed in it for simple scheduling
