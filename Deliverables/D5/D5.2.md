## Explanation:
We designed our architecture for S4 in this way so that it would be easy for the client/user to be able to operate on the front end 
without having to worry to much about the back end side of things. To do this, we have the website with its user interface set up on the front end
that uses the node.js api to communicate with our database and back end code. This makes it so that all the user has to understand is the interface
from the front end perspective and not be required to know all the intricacies of the behinds the scenes functionality since it is handled for them
by the api communication with our back end.
