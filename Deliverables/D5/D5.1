Our software is an easy to implement scheduling software. Utilizing a clear interface, the users are able to enter as many shifts over as long of a period as they would like, with no limit to how long a schedule can be, users are also able to enter available hours of many employees, the role of the employee, employee hour requests along with maximums, using this data the built in algorithm will sort through the data and fill up the schedule, displaying a fully completed version if it exists, otherwise giving the user the best available schedule of the data that is inputted. It then formats the data in a way that is easy to understand and multiple ways to display that data. This offloads the hours of work of using trial and error to create a schedule that makes everyone happy. This could be applicable to any industry a schedule is made where shifts are used and needed to be filled.
