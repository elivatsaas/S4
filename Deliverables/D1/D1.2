This initially feels very niche however with every increase in functionality the usage viability increases exponentially for all different kinds of schedulers.
We hope to reach all kinds of work schedulers in all different fields, such as resurant work, school scheduling, even potentially reaching task scheduling.
The biggest value from the customer is the options that we hope to offer letting us reach as many costomers as possible. Many softwares are very unfunished
lacking important options for specific situations that are niche but keep many potential users from using the softwares. We hope that leads to our product being 
unique in it having as many options as possible allowing things to be used and not used.
