Who was interviewed: Lorianna Martin, manager at chipotle

When: 2/5/24

Customer Segment: The customer said they mostly completed scheduling by hand due to the inconsistency and untrustworthiness of their software.
Believed many options were missing making it difficult to make a schedule that would work both theoretically and also practically.
Being able to edit things on the go was important and allowing to schedule more trustworthy workers as a seperate tier along with untrustworthy workers.
Visibility is important making sure it is easy to understand what exactly is happening without an overload of information. Make it easy on the eye's.

Key Insights: Having employee tiers is a must, visuals are important, and being able to transfer information onto paper would be a useful feature.

Assesment: Nice to have.
