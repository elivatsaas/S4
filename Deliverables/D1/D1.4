The 8 interviews that the group conducted gave us extremely valuable insight as to who we are selling this product to and the features it should have. All the "Must 
have" components from the interviews are: the ability to adjust the schedule, announcements, shift templates, shift trades, availability viewing, ease of use, and 
access to a database of labor and sales. This tells us the necessary features we should have. Other features that may be considered will be taken from the "Nice to 
have" section of the interviews. Our target customer is definitely going to include restaurants and schools as those seem to have to most need for schedules. Our 
product value comes from the ease of use we will provide. Automatically generating schedules will seem to take a heavy load off the managers and employee's in charge 
of creating them. They will become fast and efficent through our streamline process. Our product is unique because of all the features we will provide. Not only is 
automatic schedule generation unique to our product, but combined with the other useful and quality of life features we learned about in the interviews, our product 
will be superior to any other scheduling software.
