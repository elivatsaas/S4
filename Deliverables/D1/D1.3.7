Key insights from the interview

  Some users of the software aren’t good with technology, and need large text / buttons

  UI needs to be easily navigable, rather than difficult to parse

  Simple and reliable so that users can see easily when they are suppose to work  

Representative quotes

	“Some older users have trouble when using the software, and get frustrated”
 
	“Some professors show up at the wrong time, or don’t know they have a meeting because notifications don’t work, and are difficult to read”
 
	“I wish it was easier to see when my schedule is, because my times are hidden under multiple menus”
