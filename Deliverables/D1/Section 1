	Our product S4 is an all-in-one scheduling software that makes the life of the manager, employee, and supervisors easy. 
Our goal is to create software that leaves nothing out, with the ability to automate the schedule or enter manually. 
Ease to trade, drop, and pick up all shifts without requiring the use of any outside method. 
It will be able to make the schedule on its own with an algorithm that will include availability of employees, eligibility to work certain roles, requested hours, and overtime. 
We hope to include a trade, drop, and picking up shifts board that allows the higherups the option to hide and reveal whatever is necessary.
