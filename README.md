# S4
Our software is an easy to implement scheduling software.  Utilizing a clear interface, users are able to enter available hours of many employees 
and let the built-in algorithm make the schedules for them.  This offloads the hours of work of using trial and error to create a schedule that 
makes everyone happy.  This could be applicable to any industry where shifts are used.
